Fake vs Real data traning and testing python code

  * Features
      - Naive Bayes to create probabilistic classifier model
      - Text transformation (lower casing, removing stop words, text to numeric)
      - count vectorizer vs tfidf vectorizer and headlines vs full text to test which is better fits for our model
      - Sci-kit Learnâ€™s GridSearch functionality to test the performance of multiple parameters
      - Out of 10558 dataset 5279 for fake articles and 5279 for real articles
      - 5234 fake articles for testing, where our model identify 88.2% of fake news
